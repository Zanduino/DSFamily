 @mainpage Arduino Library Header to access the DS Family of 1-wire temperature sensors

 @section intro_section Description

The goal of this class is to simplify using multiple DSFamily 1-Wire thermometers from an Arduino. Particularly
when the number of attached devices is unknown, quite a bit of valuable variable memory is consumed when
allocating an array of {n} times the 8 Byte (64bit) Unique address; e.g. 128Bytes of storage would normally
be reserved if there can be up to 16 1-Wire devices.\n\n

This class stores this address information at the end of the EEPROM memory, optionally reserving space at the
beginning of EEPROM for other applications. Thus the maximum number of devices that can be processed depends upon
the space reserved and the space available on the given Atmel processor. While the number of write-cycles to
EEPROM should be limited to 10,000; the order of the 1-Wire devices is deterministic and the EEPROM.h library
calls will check to make sure that no writes are performed if the data hasn't changed, so using EEPROM for this
functionality is not an issue as few, if any, writes are done after the program has been run with a given
configuration.\n\n

Access to the devices is done with an index number rather than the 64-Bit unique address, simplifying using the
device. Several methods are built into the library to simplify basic operations on multiple thermometers,
including allowing one of the thermometer readings to be ignored - important if one of the devices is placed
elsewhere - i.e. one thermometer is on the board to measure ambient temperature, or one thermometer is placed
directly on the evaporator plate in a refrigerator or freezer and is thus much colder than the others.\n\n

While the DS Family of thermometers are quite accurate, there can still be significant variations between readings.
The class contains a calibration routine which assumes that all of the devices are at the same temperature and
will use the DS-Family's 2 User-definable bytes to store offset calibration information which ensures a significant
improvement in accuracy.\n\n

The Maxim DSFamily of thermometers use the 1-Wire microLAN protocol. There is an excellent library for 1-Wire,
written by Paul Stoffregen and located at http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html. There is also an
informative page at http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/OneWire describing how to use the library. As there
are parts of the code that are unnecessary for this DS implementation and in order to make this library self-
sufficient, the code from version 2.0 (extracted 2016-11-23), has been included in this library.

@section doxygen doxygen configuration

This library is built with the standard "Doxyfile", which is located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/blob/main/Doxygen. As described on that page, there are only 5
environment variables used, and these are set in the project's actions file, located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/DSFamily/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-doxygen.yml
Edit this file and set the 5 variables -  PRETTYNAME, PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_NUMBER, PROJECT_BRIEF
and PROJECT_LOGO so that these values are used in the doxygen documentation.
The local copy of the doxyfile should be in the project's root directory in order to do local
doxygen testing, but the file is ignored on upload to GitHub.

@section clang-format
Part of the GitHub actions for CI is running every source file through "clang-format" to ensure
that coding formatting is done the same for all files. The configuration file ".clang-format" is
located at https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/tree/main/clang-format and this is used for CI tests
when pushing to GitHub. The local file, if present in the root directory, is ignored when
committing and uploading.
